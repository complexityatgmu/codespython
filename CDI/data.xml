<comments>The Zambezi river levels reached  6.31m on 11 March 2013 as compared to the normal levels at 4.21m. 

The flooding caused damage to the homes, roads, dams, fields and destroyed livestock and livelihoods, with the majority of the houses in the flood plains inundated. The road networks have been cut off, making it difficult for the communities to access essential services such as clinics. Some of these clinics were also inundated and had to be closed. According to the findings of the rapid assessment led by the government, 4,000 families, including 4,527 children, are impacted by the floods, with up to 2,500 families already evacuated to different relocation camps as of 12 March 2013.</comments>

<comments>Sierra Leone is experiencing the Harmatten wind, (December to March) which is a dry dusty wind blowing across the Sahara desert right through costal West African countries, causing bush fires which leads to the burning of huge farmlands, villages and other environmental entities.

Bompilia village in Bonthe district and Dandabu village in Pujehun district lost all 45 houses in the two communities excluding a mosque and 10 fishing bands. Other subsistence resources like fishing nets and accessories were all burnt. This has rendered the residents in the two communities homeless and deprived of basic leaving standards.

<comments>In 2012 Moldova suffered one of the most severe droughts in the recent history causing huge reductions in yields and crop failure. 
Maize yields declined by 59% and sunflower yields declined by 53% compared to the multiannual average.
While no shortfalls in food availability are envisaged, there could be serious problems in economic access to the food for the poorest members of Moldovan society, as due to the demands the prices of food available in the market has been increased. 
Although at the aggregated national level, the impact of the 2012 drought seems to be less severe than the previous drought of 2007, in the South region of Moldova and in some parts of the Centre region, the impact of the 2012 drought appears to be more intense. The Southern region as the most affected one registered the most severe drops in production in the country, in particular for the maize and sunflower crops. Similar impacts are expected for the Transnistria region. According to the Minister of Economy, Moldova might lose over 1.5% of economic growth this year due to the drought effects.

<comments>Since 2002, over 515,000 Burundians have voluntary returned home. More than 94,000 Burundians are still refugees in the neighboring countries, including in Tanzania. In 2011, the Government of Tanzania decided to close Mtabila Camp and subsequently, to repatriate by force if necessary, the refugees by the end of 2012. As a result a cessation clause has been invoked for 37,592 of them who therefore, no longer enjoy the official refugee status as of 1 August 2012.  On 8 October 2012, the Governments of Burundi and Tanzania, UNHCR, partners and donors met and agreed to repatriate those ?former? Burundian refugees, some 35,000.</comments>

<comments>During its passage through Cuba, Sandy left significant damages behind, particularly in the city of Santiago de Cuba which is not usually in the direct path of Caribbean hurricanes, and the city sustained the strongest winds as it was exposed to the eastern and stronger side of the hurricane. In addition to the strong winds, the coast was also affected by storm surges. In Siboney, some 14 kilometres from Santiago city, the waves were some 10 metres above the coastal barrier, with the ocean reaching some 35 metres inland. </comments>

<comments>Hurricane Sandy reached 24 October 2012 Jamaica as category 1 hurricane, making a landfall over southeastern Jamaica around 19:00UTC (2pm local time) with 129k/h winds with severe torrential rains hitting the country. Hurricane caused one fatality and fallen branches and metal parts wounded some people. Several roads were blocked by fallen trees which caused inaccessibility to many communities but clearing of roads were done and many roads are again becoming functionable. Fallen trees have caused cutting of electric wires causing electricity cuts in many communities (i.e. capital Kingston area, St. Thomas, St. Mary and Portland parishes). Due to electricity cuts, northeaster-eastern part of the country has many communities without water and they are either using their water tank reserves or getting water from the rivers. Airports were closed for one day but both Montego Bay airport and Sangsters International Airport are now open.</comments>

<comments>Rainfall deficits in July 2012 affected basic grain crops in numerous departments of the eastern and central regions of Guatemala, as well as in some departments of the western region. The lack of rain, combined with the presence of crop pests and diseases, led to the loss of maize and bean crops in these areas, ranging from 69 to 97 per cent, with departments in Chiquimula recording the greatest losses. By 22 Aug, almost 40,000 families were affected by the drought and the government launched an action plan to mitigate the effects.</comments>

<comments>Based on the results of its post-harvest food security assessment, the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee projected that in the April 2012 to March 2013 consumption period, 1,63 million people in 15 mainly southern districts will be unable to adequately access food in order to meet their basic needs. Southern Malawi has faced several consecutive years of poor harvests as a result of weather-related shocks, especially dry spells. In addition, the devaluation and depreciation of the local currency in May 2012 has significantly lowered consumer purchasing power as prices of basic commodities and staple food continue to rise. On 14 Aug 2012, the Government of Malawi sent a final food security response plan with an appeal of $89 million to the UN Resident Coordinator.</comments>

<comments>In 2012, the combined production of cereals in Lesotho was the lowest in 10 years, representing only 32% of the average annual harvest. Food price and other cost of living increases are intensifying the impact of the poor harvest. Preliminary Lesotho Vulnerability Assessment Committee (LVAC) results indicated that 725,000 people were food insecure. The government declared a food crisis situation on 9 Aug 2012 and called on development partners to assist.</comments>

<comments>Starting at the end of June 2012, heavy seasonal rains caused flooding in several parts of South Sudan. Many roads within Abyei were flooded, restricting the possible return of people displaced from the area and hampering the movement of humanitarian actors. In Upper Nile State, Jamam camp, home to 120,000 refugees from Sudan?s Blue Nile State, was flooded, prompting a relocation to a new site in Gendrassa. The rains also hampered assistance to about 7,000 people displaced by conflict in Northern Bahr el Ghazal. Furthermore, flooding caused displacement in Juba county, Unity State and Jonglei State.</comments>

<comments>The Ghana Health Service has officially declared the cholera outbreak in the country. Because of the high mobility of people from one community to another as a result of funerals, trade, and other personal and commercial activities it is envisaged that the epidemics will spread very fast if massive intervention measures are not taken within the shortest possible time. According to the Ghana Health service as at the second week of April 2012 there were 684 reported cases of cholera with 17 deaths, but as at 24th April 2012, over 1,570 cases have been recorded with 21 cases in 2 Regions of Ghana. In Greater Accra region the numbers of reported cases are 1,270 with 20 deaths and Eastern Region 300 confirmed cases with 1 death recorded. 
This outbreak spread is related to poor sanitation conditions and migration from   affected regions to other regions.

<comments>The Red Sea state in the eastern part of Sudan hosts a large population that is predominantly dependent on subsistence farming and pastoralism. The consistent drought cycles have heavily impacted negatively on the community?s coping mechanism, with reports over the last few months documenting a progressive deterioration of the food security situation. The weather conditions over the last two seasons have not been favourable to support rain-fed agriculture practiced by the local people. Consequently, food production and access to food is diminishing and huge food gaps in households is being experienced. According to various reports, the situation is expected to continue deteriorating and not likely to improve until the next harvests are realized. An assessment conducted by the Sudanese Red Crescent Society and its partners in January 2012 confirmed that at least 257,197 people (51,440 households on the basis of five members per family) in the Red Sea state are food insecure and in need of immediate food aid. </comments>

<comments>The late, erratic and unevenly distributed rainfall during the 2011/12 cropping season led to a significant decline and low quality of agricultural production in The Gambia. Overall crop production is estimated to drop by 62% compared to 2010 and by 50% compared to the 5-year in average. Compared to last year, particularly affected is the production of key food and cash crops such as rice (-74%), millet (-54%) and groundnut (-64%). This reduces the availability and access of food at household level, thereby increasing the lean period from the normal two month period up to 8 months according to the post harvest assessment report. 
Of the 39 rural districts affected, 19 are considered the hardest hit by crop failure with a total population of 428,000, including 73,802 children under the age of 5. 177,000 of the hardest hit are at the borderline meaning they have already started using some coping mechanisms such as reducing number of meals from 3 to 1 meal per day and/or sending some members of family to relatives to reduce the burden</comments>

<comments>Viet Nam experienced an unprecedented outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in 2011, and while appropriate and effective action was taken by Viet Nam Red Cross working with the authorities, the country, as a whole, continues to experience a disturbingly high incidence of the disease. 

As of 15 March 2012, the total number of cases reported by all provinces was higher than the annual caseloads in 2009-2010, as well as 7.5 times higher than the same period last year. There is also concern of a further surge of cases in the coming weeks, considering the customary April-May and September-October peaks recorded in previous years.

<comments>Ferocious rains brought on by tropical depression TD17F caused flooding in most parts of Fiji, worsening states that were still revcoering from the Jan/Feb 2012 floods. The tropical storm, which has already killed four people in Fiji, with three young boys missing at sea, has been upgraded to a cyclone Daphene as of today. 

The western division is the worst affected, particularly the main cities of Sigatoka, Nadi, Lautoka, Tabua, Ba and Rakiraki, all of which have been flooded up to two meters of water in places. Water and electricity supplies are disrupted in the western division, affecting approximately 150,000 people. The extent of damages to houses, schools and infrastructure is currently unknown as access to communities is difficult. The Water Authority Fiji (WAF) reports that in Ba, Tavua, Rakiraki and Sigatoka all pumping stations are out of operation and there is no inflow into treatment plants. In Nadi and Lautoka it is expected there will be no supply of water due to low pressure. The hospital and airport have reserved supplies. 

A state of natural disaster for Western division of Fiji has been officially declared by the Fijian Government.

<comments>The Ministry of Health and Sanitation has officially declared the cholera outbreak in 3 branches/districts in the country on the 8th March 2012.No one knows exactly how it started, but health authorities believe  that it may have  started in Kambia one of the affected branches which shares boundary with Guinea. And  because of the high mobility of people from one community to another as a result of funerals, trade, and other personal and commercial activities, the disease has spread quickly to other districts/branches, it is envisaged that the epidemics will  continue to spread very fast if urgent and appropriate action is not taken to address the unfolding situation. Already other branches/ districts aside from the 3 districts mentioned above are also reporting severe cases of watery diarrhoea .As at March 9th 2012, the total numbers of cases reported from the 3 cholera-declared districts of Port Loko and Kambia in the North and Pujehun in the South are 2,137 with 34 fatalities.</comments>

<comments>The conflict which forced many people to leave Northern Mali to Burkina Faso has further weakened the region that has been facing the risk of food insecurity. The situation has plunged the people into destitution and deprivation which exposes them to all kinds of risks including diseases the spread of which is facilitated by poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. The upheaval, its attendant trauma coupled with lack of basic amenities and facilities is not helping the affected population. The number of refugees now stands at 12,297 located in municipalities of Tin Akoff, in the province of Inabao Deou in Oudalan, Gandafabou, Mentao and Soum. </comments>

<comments>Following the armed conflict in the northern part of Mali, the refugees fleeing Mali entered Mauritania, mainly Fassala in the district of Bassikounou located in the far South-East. More than 11,000 people have already crossed the border in Mauritania. With the poor rainfall registered in 2011, the Hodh Chargui region (where Fassala is located) is already facing an alarming nutrition crisis. The arrival of the Malian refugees constitutes an additional pressure on the poor resources, and this situation deeply weakens an already desperate humanitarian context for both the refugees and the host communities. Therefore, the arrival of these Malian refugees aggravates this gloomy picture. </comments>

<comments>Malawi has been receiving heavy rains associated with heavy storms in many parts of the country since late December 2011 which has led to flash floods and destruction of infrastructure like houses, school blocks and others in different districts of the country. Among the districts affected so far are Thyolo, Phalombe, Chikwawa and Nsanje in the southern region, Dedza and Salima in the central region and Nkhata Bay, Rumphi and Karonga in northern region of Malawi as being the worst affected respectively. The total number of houses affected according to the Government?s Department of Disaster Management Affairs is 5270 households as of mid January 2012 (either their houses have completely fallen, been partly damaged, or they have experienced crop damage). 

The latest heavy rains were experienced in Traditional Authority Mlolo in Nsanje District from 22nd January 2012 where a total of 6,159 people (about 1235 households) have been affected and these numbers are likely to increase as assessment is still going on. Most of the affected households have nowhere to stay since the waters have not completely receded

heavy rainfall, hit southern Mozambique on 15 Jan 2012 and caused flooding and damage to houses and schools in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane. Heavy rainfall in South Africa and Swaziland caused a steady increase of water levels in the Maputo, Umbeluzi and Incomati Basins, flooding low-lying areas in Magude and Chokwe. Tropical Cyclone Funso, which is moving towards central Mozambique, may affect coastal areas of Zambezia Province.</comments>

<comments>Due to extremely low temperatures followed by a heavy snow-fall approximately twenty municipalities have been cut off from the rest of the country. The snow blast took place from early Thursday, 2nd February 2012 and since then it has continued snowing. The most affected municipalities are Han Pijesak, Sokolac, ?ajni?e, Srebrenica, Kalinovik, Istocni Stari Grad and Kladanj.  Blocked roads, power shortages and broken communication lines made it almost impossible to reach the affected areas. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has declared state of emergency because of the situation in the affected areas. </comments>

<comments>The cold wave that affects the last few days Morocco will persist until the end of the week with a peak on Wednesday and Thursday, as announced by the national weather forecast service.
Going about this, the result of a polar air mass that passes through the eastern and central Europe affects northern Africa from Tunisia to Morocco. Minimum temperatures have broken records for the month of February in several regions with low degrees, and very rarely for years, recorded. The temperature was close to minus 7 degrees Celsius on the mountainous regions, from -1 to 3 on the middle and 5 to 8 on the coast.
As consequence, roads and mountain passes were blocked by snowfalls, the electricity was interrupted and some houses suffered structural damages. In addition, with low temperatures, water pipes froze, interrupting the water supply in many regions.</comments>

<comments>Freezing weather has killed dozens of people in Central and Eastern Europe over the past few days and temperatures are set to drop even further according to weather forecasts. The situation worsened in Ukraine since bitter cold with heavy snowstorms hit the country last week, with temperatures falling to 12-15 degrees Celsius below zero (10-5F), local media reported on Tuesday. The temperature has reached minus 30 C on 25 January 2012. 

At least 32 people have died in Ukraine according to official sources. Most of them were homeless who froze to death in the streets or old people who died in their flats or after hospitalization 
Until 27 January 2012, 627 people have requested medical, assistance because of frostbite and hypothermia with 544 of them admitted to hospitals. The effect from the cold wave turned serious due to several factors that relate to the bad social economic situation, high number of people living below poverty level, and many people living without permanent address (homeless).

<comments>More than two weeks since the typhoon struck, overcrowding in evacuation centres and access to proper sanitation facilities remain to be the top concern. As of reporting period, more than 37,200 families are housed inside 54 evacuation centres. With the classes that resumed after the holiday season, evacuees who sought temporary shelters in schools were forced to transfer to different establishments such as gymnasiums. This resulted to outbreak of leptospirosis - an infection caused by the Leptospira bacteria that enters the human body through wounds or broken skin when in contact with flood waters, vegetation, or moist soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals, especially rats. As of 3 January 2012, DOH confirmed 128 cases with at least four deaths. An addition of 200 suspected cases has been monitored by DOH.</comments>

<comments>On 7 December the Public Health Provincial Director of Monse?or Nouel province confirmed a cholera outbreak in Bonao municipality, located some 93 Kilometres from Santo Domingo. On that day, 13 new cases with suspected symptoms of diarrhoea, vomits and abdominal pain were registered in Dr. Pedro Emilio de Marchena Hospital in Bonao; figures that increased on the following days. Patients were from the communities of Jima, El Abanico, Blanco, La Base, Ca?o Piedra, Canal Piedra and Seiba, all communities dependent on the R?o de Blanco aqueduct. As a result, the contamination of the aqueduct was considered the main source of the outbreak. 

Although precise figures are still unclear, provincial health authorities estimate that some 220 persons have been hospitalized, with one fatality reported.  However, by 14 December, and after intense measures to contain the outbreak, the number of suspected cases had decreased significantly and only 13 patients were still hospitalized.

<comments>Twenty years after the first Somali refugees fled the crisis that ousted President Siad Barre, more than 900,000 Somalis are now refugees in neighboring countries and some 1.5 million are internally displaced. Thousands of them continue to pour across the border to north-eastern of Kenya into the largest refugee complex in the world (Dadaab). Consequent years of drought, shrinking humanitarian space and lack of access to the affected populations in South-Central Somalia, especially in areas where famine is declared and are largely controlled by Alshabab Militant movement, have worsened the food insecurity conditions and triggered population influx towards neighboring countries, with Kenya being the largest recipient country</comments>

<comments>On Wednesday, a stranded cargo ship, the Rena, had run aground after an oil spill on the Astrolable Reef off port Tarunga, New Zealand.

The Maritime New Zealand estimates 350 tonnes of oil leaked from the Rena, and it is believed the ship had 1,900 tonnes of oil and diesel on-board. Despite an International salvage response to refloat the vessel the situation has worsened over the past few days due to the adverse weather conditions.

The Rena has suffered substantial structure failure, with cracks appearing in the hull. This has been caused by the movement of the vessel as the stern, which has remained afloat, shifting with the waves, while the front part of the ship remains stuck on the reef.

Urgent aerial surveillance is required. Current weather conditions are hampering such operations. Suitable EOS applications are now required to assist in the detection of pollution. The owners of the ship are making every effort to minimise any further damages to the environment.

International Disaster Charter (IDC) has been triggered by this event.</comments>

This weather front, combined with the effects of previous precipitations and the saturation of soils since early October, has caused severe damages in the Western and Southern regions of Costa Rica, (Valle Central, Pac?fico Sur, Pac?fico Central, Huetar Norte, Huetar Atl?ntica) particularly in the provinces of Guanacaste and Puntarenas where a state of yellow alert was declared by the government on 8 October.  </comments>

<comments>A week after fighting broke out between the Sudan Armed Forces and members of the Sudan People?s Liberation Movement (North) September 1st approximately, the volatile security situation in Sudan?s Blue Nile State continues to drive civilians out of their homes into exile in Ethiopia. Initially 4,000 refugees entering into Kurmuk, in western Ethiopia. This followed reports of renewed clashes in the Sudan side of Kurmuk. There are an estimated 20,000 plus Sudanese refugees who crossed into Ethiopia over the past week. The humanitarian needs are expected to increase as existing Government of Ethiopia (GoE/ARRA) and UNHCR camp capacity is overwhelmed. With hostilities escalating new camp sites have been identified and are under preparation in anticipation of increased caseloads. </comments>

This tropical storm lingered northeast of Dominica and produced heavy rains over the island from 25 to 29 September, 2011.

<comments>Tuvalu, a country of nine islands north of Fiji has a population of about 10,000 people with almost 50 per cent living on Funafuti, which is the capital island. The country depends mostly on rain water with some islands having access to ground water. Since early this year, all islands in the group have been suffering from lack of water due to the LaNina effect, which has impacted the islands? agriculture and daily water consumption. 

Nukulaelae, an island south of Funafuti has reported that the island is very low on fresh drinking water and has requested the government for assistance.

<comments>This year, India has witnessed severe floods in six states, affecting more than 11 million people across India. The Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) launched a domestic appeal to seek support of the domestic donors for the flood affected states. However, response to the appeal has so far been limited. More recently 2.2 million people have also been affected by floods in the Odisha (formerly known as Orissa) state, which was originally not under the domestic appeal, but will now be included. As the IRCS capacities are already stressed to cope with the situation, DREF has been requested to allow Indian Red Cross to support 75,000 beneficiaries in Odisha through distribution of non food relief items and safe drinking water. Where required, volunteers will carry out dissemination of hygiene promotion and safe storage of water in emergencies. In the coming weeks, IRCS will revise their domestic appeal to include Odisha.</comments>

<comments>Floods have killed 37 people in north and north-eastern Thailand, and some 1.5 million people are affected. Thirteen provinces still remain under water even after tropical storm Nock Ten. Weeks of torrential rains poured, prompting rivers to swell before eventually overflowing. Excess river water gushed into neighboring refugee camps in the Mae Hongson province, destroying hundreds of temporary shelters and causing substantial destruction. Mae Ra Ma Luang and Mae La Oon camps were badly affected, forcing more than 2,000 people to flee their homes.</comments>

<comments>Around four in the afternoon on 8 August a hailstorm with strong winds struck the department of Itap&amp;uacute;a, destroying homes and crops. The most affected areas are the districts of Mayor Otao and Carlos Antonio L&amp;oacute;pez, which are located 180 kilometres to the north of Encarnaci&amp;oacute;n, the departmental capital.

The hailstorm, which lasted around half and hour and carried hails as large as 8 cm, created serious damages to the fibre cement roofing used in the area. The situation was then exacerbated when the hailstorm was followed by strong rain. Thus far the police has not informed about death related to the emergency. </comments>

<comments>Category 2/3 Hurricane Irene passed over The Bahamas from August 23&apos;&quot; to August 26&apos;h 2011. Moving across the entire archipelago, hurricane force winds and rain impacted the entire chain of islands causing damage and disrupting services in sorne islands. Hurricane Irene also passed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on August 24&apos;h 2011 as a Category 1 hurricane resulting in damage.
Preliminary reports are that impact occurred on the Southern and Central Islands of Cat Island, Great Exuma, long Island, Crooked Island, and Eleuthera affecting up to 10,000 persons. There are no reports of deaths or injuries. Approximately 150 houses were damaged and an additional number of schools and public buildings receiving varying degree of damage. Several of the islands fisherman received wind damage to fishing boats and impacts on health systems were limited and did not disrupt health services. Most severe impact was caused by downed power lines to the electricity grid and an approximate 10,000 persons remain without power. Due to power outages, compounded impacts in food security and water systems which rely on consistent power are affected.
The disaster situation is expected to improve as power is restored gradually to the affected islands. Prior to the hurricane impacting The Bahamas, relatively high cases of dengue were present in main island of New Providence. Although other islands did not have the same dengue situation prior to the hurricane, there is a concern that additional water and lack of attention to the situation could increase dengue.</comments>

<comments>A considerable number of districts in Bangladesh have reported flooding during the past two days with Cox?s Bazar district badly affected. Seasonal floods were compounded by factors such as heavier rainfall, increase of tidal water level due to depression in the Bay of Bengal and overflow of water from areas upstream (the hills of India and Mayanmar). Around 300,000 people in Cox&apos;s Bazar district are reported to be marooned as the flood situation deteriorated. Many people have moved to cyclone shelters, school buildings while some seek refuge on the main  roads along with families and livestock as rainwater has now entered into their houses. To date the area has suffered a loss of ten lives due to this year?s floods.</comments>

Bopa in Mono and in the Cotonou Littoral. These areas are classified as high risk flood areas. According to information received from local authorities and local branches of the Red Cross, some districts that has never been flooded before were affected by the flood.

No loss of lives has been reported due to the Early Warning System that was put in place in the 22 municipalities, but there has been extensive damage to poultry and livestock; also hectatres of farmalnd and crops has been destroyed. </comments>

<comments>Following the contested elections in South Kordofan State results announcements, tensions built up between the main political parties (SPLM ? Sudan People?s Liberation Movement and NCP- National Congress Party) taking part in the elections with the SPLM candidate claiming widespread fraud. The rising political tension spilled out into active fighting on 5th of June, starting in Kadugli, the capital of South Kordofan State and spreading throughout the state within days and affecting populations in 11  out of the 19 localities. The fighting, which involved use of both ground and air strikes, put thousands of people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Estimates indicate more than 70,000 people are affected by this crisis  and even as the situation is reportedly calming down it remains fragile and unpredictable .  Within 10 days of the fighting populations affected are reported to have moved out of the conflict zones towards North Kordofan State (App. 18,500 People) and as far as to Khartoum State (App. 5,000 persons are reported to have arrived and settled in scattered shanty areas mainly Mayo, Umbada, and Haj Yousif in Khartoum). Looting and private property destruction of both civilians and humanitarian agencies was reported to be rampant during this period, making a population already vulnerable due to a long lasting conflict, even more so with little to use to meet their immediate needs and restore their livelihoods and a hampered humanitarian response to assist them. </comments>

<comments>On 22 May, Germany reported a significant increase in the number of patients with haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhoea caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). Since the end of April, 138 cases of HUS have been reported. While HUS, caused by STEC infections, is usually observed in children under 5 years of age, in this outbreak the great majority of cases are adults, with more than two thirds being women. Two of the HUS cases have died. Preliminary diagnostic investigations indicate that serogroup O104 (Stx2-positve, eae-negative) might be the causative agent.</comments>

<comments>In 22 April, 2011 heavy rains started to fall in different areas in Iraq and continued for more than 35 hours, causing floods and severe damages to several governorates. &quot;The incessant rains led to massive flooding, the biggest in the area in more than ten years,&quot; according to officials. 
During three hours of rain in Erbil, 62 millimeters of water affected more than 6 areas (Glikand, Setaqan, Tayrawa, Azadi, Minara and Badawa); where due to a stream of heavy rain hundred of houses in Erbil have been plunged in flood, not to mention that  cars stalled in water on the main streets.
In addition to that, water also entered Erbil&apos;s Azadi Badawa and Daratoo power stations; where all three stations were turned off temporarily, leaving some neighborhoods temporarily without electricity. Rains also affected Suliemaniya, Nineveh , Dohuk , Salahaddin and Karbala governorates

<comments>Nigeria?s presidential election peacefully conducted on 16 April, 2011 turned violent as results of the election started coming out on 17 April, 2011. Violent protests were recorded mostly in the northern part of Nigeria where some of the main presidential contenders come from. Angry youths took to major streets in the north especially in Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi, Gombe, Niger and Borno States protesting the outcome of the election. Property including houses and vehicles were burnt while many lives were lost. However, the intervention of security operatives including military personnel deployed in the troubled areas as well as imposition of curfew brought the situation under control after 3 days of protests. According to the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), more than 75,000 people were displaced, 288 deaths and 452 injured. </comments>

<comments>The region of Mayo Kebbi East is a cholera prone area. In the past few years, cholera outbreak was triggered by flood. But this year, just after the end of February first cases of cholera started to be confirmed in the region. The Chadian government and its humanitarian partners carried out evaluation mission and declared the zone as a disaster area. The local health facilities are underequipped and are currently overwhelmed by cholera affected victims. As of 30 March, a total of 1,432 persons were affected by cholera epidemics out of which 30 deaths were recorded according to the Chadian health Ministry delegation in Bongor. The most affected areas are: Bongor, Djoumane, Kim, Koyom, Samga and Er?. Poor water and sanitation facilities especially in villages and lack of hygiene education among the communities are the main factors of the cholera outbreak.</comments>

The failed short rains led to unfavourable crop and livestock productions. This is being experienced and an estimated 855,000 affected people are now coping through livestock migration, voluntary livestock off take through sale, pooling resources to purchase water and pasture for livestock, dropping out of pastoralism to small holder crop farming, especially those living around permanent rivers such as River Tana and Ewaso Nyiro. </comments>

<comments>The political stalemate in the West Africa?s nation of C?te d?Ivoire since the re-run of the presidential election was conducted on 28 November 2010 has been posing humanitarian concerns not only in C?te d?Ivoire but in the region as well. The country?s Independent Electoral Commission had declared the opposition candidate Alassane Ouatarra the winner of the run off on 2 December 2010 but was overturned by the country?s Constitutional Council which announced the incumbent President Gbagbo the winner though the international community including the UN recognized the victory of the opposition candidate. Since the two opposing candidates have taken oaths of office in different locations on 4 December 2010 and forming parallel governments in C?te d?Ivoire, there have been protests in the country even before and after the presidential election run-off. The situation has affected movement of people and goods within the country thereby leading to increase in cost of living as prices of food ingredients have soared. The fear of violence has also led to the movement of some people into neighbouring Liberia and Guinea Conakry. An estimated 4,000 people had entered Liberia with new arrivals reported in villages along the border at a rate now of around 150 people per day. Meanwhile in Guinea, the number of newly registered Ivorian refugees in the southeast of the country is stable at some 186 people. As the political solution is being sought to the stalemate, there is the fear of increased population movement from C?te d?Ivoire into Guinea, Liberia as well as Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mali to some extent in the coming days and this may lead to humanitarian needs in these countries. </comments>

<comments>Due to the heavy rainfalls in recent days in the northern part of Albania, the Drini river level has been increasing, which has consequently increased the water levels in three connected lakes near hydroelectric power plants.

The authorities were obliged to open the emergency dam gates and release the water from the lakes into the Shkodra lake, which, together with heavy rainfalls, caused flooding in the prefectures of Shkodra and Lezha affecting more than 14,000 people. </comments>

<comments>The weather phenomenon La Ni?a has had an enormous effect across Colombia since its development by mid year of 2010. Since March, it has brought rains above historical records, causing landslides, flash floods, breakage of barriers, and therefore ongoing floods in 28 departments and 561 municipalities around the country.  Thus far, there are some 257,849 affected families (1,211,146 persons), 208 injured, 139 deaths, 23 missing people, and 204,794 damaged homes. The more impacted departments are Bolivar, with 264,000 affected people, followed by Magdalena with 161,000, C?rdoba with 151,000 and Sucre with 107,000. 
Unfortunately, the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies forecasts that La Ni?a phenomenon and its strong rains will continue until the first trimester of 2011. This could mean the overlapping of the rainy seasons of 2010 with the first rainy season of 2011 (March-April-May).
 
On 18 November, the Minister of Justice, German Vargas Lleras, declared a state of public calamity in 28 of the 32 Departments of the country. The government hopes to facilitate the gathering of additional resources, as the country?s capabilities have been overloaded. This declaration also fastens the processes to receive international aid and supports subjects such as housing and agriculture.</comments>

<comments>Tropical Storm Tomas has resulted in wide spread roof loss, downed power lines and fallen trees across Barbados. Over 17 inches of rain was reported at the airport. Approximately, 130 homes have been damaged, mainly in the parishes of St. George and St. Lucy, though damage has also been reported in the parishes of St. Phillip, St. Andrew, St. Joseph, St. Michael and St. Michel. 80% of the electrical service to Barbados was disrupted and water supply was significantly reduced in many areas, although both services are now being restored. Brown water contamination has also been reported in some areas. The disruption to water services has left some polyclinics closed. Telephone lines are still experiencing disruption across the island but cell phones are operational.</comments>

<comments>In St Lucia, the brunt of the storm was felt in the southern part of the island. The island experienced sustained winds of 90 - 95 mph which caused significant loss and damage to several houses and small commercial structures in communities. Altogether 110 houses in Roseau Valley have been reported with roof damage and severe flooding; in Bruceville, 45 houses have lost their roofs forcing 163 persons to accommodate in shelters. The area of Soufriere has been cut off by landslides and is currently inaccessible by land. Laborie has experienced severe flooding. The dam at Roseau is currently inaccessible, causing irregularity in the water service. Choc and Bois D&apos;orange bridges have been destroyed between Castries and Gros Islet.

<comments>The torrential rains of September and early October 2010 in West Africa especially in Benin and Togo have caused the overflow of rivers and consequently caused flooding in many parts of Togo especially in the South. The rainy season started in Togo in June and immediately the downpour have been causing severe flooding in many parts of the country with a lot of humanitarian concerns. The Togolese Red Cross since worked in collaboration with UNICEF and other humanitarian agencies to assist the affected population, the floods have caused damages to bridges and roads most in the Maritime region of Togo. The Togolese Red Cross Emergency First Aid Team members deployed to the field have reported that 50 communities in 4 prefectures were mostly affected with 1 death, many injured and families displaced now sheltered in the 3 government temporary camps while some others have crossed over to neighbouring Benin Republic for shelter. The 4 most affected prefectures with devastating damages to property including houses are Yoto, Bas-Mono, Golfe and Lacs all in the Maritime Region. The Togolese Red Cross, after a preliminary assessment, has registered 5,910 families affected by the floods in this region, most of them are peasants who lost their houses and means of livelihood to the disaster.                                         </comments>

<comments>An outbreak of poliomyelitis provoked by a wild poliovirus of type I was reported in Tajikistan in March. It is the first outbreak of imported poliomyelitis in WHO European region since it was certified polio-free in 2002.  Uzbekistan has also reported one AFP case in Tashkent which was under investigation.
 
The polio outbreak in the region can have severe adverse impact on public health and is a signal to introduction of a higher state of anti-epidemic preparedness in all neighbouring countries. Although the vaccination rate in Kyrgyzstan officially is around 95 percent, anecdotal evidences suggest that coverage might be less (around 60 percent) in certain areas, particularly among migrants and in remote settlements

After laboratory analysis, 303 cases tested positive for the Chikungunya virus, 84 cases diagnosed with the Dengue virus, while 15 other cases of co-infections were discovered. No death has been reported yet.The Provinces affected by these epidemics are Ogoou? Lolo and Haut Ogoou?, specifically the towns of Franceville, Lastourville and Koulamoutou.

<comments>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) states that the El Ni?o in the Equatorial Pacific continues to sustain its moderate strength and is recently in his mature stage.  Gradual decrease in sea surface temperature is expected but still within the El Ni?o threshold and likely to last up to June 2010.  To date, Regions I, II and XII have been experiencing dry spell conditions such as drought, increased temperature, decreased rainfall and water supply which affected agricultural productions such as rice, corn and vegetables in 165,071 hectares with estimated production loss of PhP2.4B.</comments>

<comments>Since December 2009, Bangladesh?s northern and South-west region have been experiencing a severe cold wave. The cold wave combined with dense fog has had an adverse impact on the agriculture and fisheries sector as well as the quality of life of normal people. Poor people in the northern region of the country have been the worst affected. Struggling to ward off the night cold, the local population has faced a significant rise in respiratory illnesses, and in some cases death.</comments>

<comments>Beginning from the end of December 2009, Mongolia saw a sharp and sudden drop of temperature combined with continuous heavy snowfall, recognized locally as dzud. The current situation has caused a loss of hundreds of thousands of livestock, leaving numerous herders without any source of livelihood. As the dzud is a slow-on-set disaster which continues for weeks and months, there are challenges in gathering information and conducting emergency assessments. (IFRC)</comments>

The tremors, with a magnitude of 5.8 on the Richter scale, caused over eight earth tremors during the first day, affecting approximately 3,000 households and the patients at the Karonga district hospital. Although verification is incomplete, 1,929 affected cases have already been confirmed. Major damage has been triggered by the collapse of walls, rendering houses completely uninhabitable.
According to reports received from the Karonga District Assembly, 15 people were injured, nine of whom have been hospitalised. The death of a year-old child, who died of serious injuries after a wall fell on him during the morning of 8 December 2009, has also been reported. </comments>

Government Health Department predicts that the cases of diarrhoea could be of similar nature and aetiology.</comments>

<comments>Cyclone AILA ripped coastal West Bengal on 25 May 2009 unleashing storms that uprooted trees, electricity poles and thatched homes, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake, killing approx 30 people and affecting 100,000 others.

A severe storm with a wind speed of 110 kmph accompanied by heavy rainfall preceded the cyclone ripping through the districts of Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly. The coastal blocks like Sagar, Namkhana, Kakdwip and also Patharpraima, Canning, Basanti, Mathurapur and Kultali have all been severely affected and casualties have been reported. The West Bengal state?s Disaster Management Minister told BBC that 100,000 people had become homeless. The accompanying rains caused water-logging in large parts of the city, while power supply remained erratic and several flights were cancelled. Nearly four people were killed and 15 injured in Kolkata due to the storm that paralysed normal life. The usually bustling city streets were deserted since noon, as the authorities stopped tram services and asked people to stay indoors till evening.  

The city administration and police swung into action and virtual emergency was declared. Assistance of army has also been sought to help the civil administration in tackling the action.

Cyclonic storm AILA also paralysed life in several parts of Coastal Orissa triggering heavy rains and high velocity winds prompting government to gear up for relief work. No casualties have been reported so far.

According to the Regional Meteorological Centre Director, the cyclone now lying stationery 50 km west of Kolkata is moving in a northerly direction and will weaken gradually to a depression affecting the Northern and North Eastern states of India.

<comments>The city of Goma and the area of Nyiragongo located at the bottom of the volcano are and will remain high risk areas. Since January 2009, the Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira volcanoes have been showing the following signs: recurrent seismic swarms of volcanic nature; great range volcano tremors at the seismographic station of Rusayo, where they happened more frequently than in other stations. This means that the volcano tremors mainly come from Nyiragongo, which lake of lava  is very active.    </comments>

<comments>Following the Government of Sudan?s decision on 4 March 2009 to order thirteen international humanitarian agencies and three national NGOs working in Darfur and other parts of the country to leave, concerns have mounted over possible humanitarian gaps and the availability of operational, management, and coordination capacities to deliver humanitarian assistance. The Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS) was approached by the authorities to explore possibilities to fill some gaps, not only in Darfur state but also in the rest of the country. The Federation, working in support to the National Society, has been closely monitoring the situation and has had a number of meetings with key stakeholders within and outside the Movement to gain a better understanding of the humanitarian impact and consequences, and to explore an expanded role for the SRCS within its mandate and capacities.</comments>

<comments>On 2/11/2009 5:34:50 PM UTC an earthquake of magnitude 7.2 and depth 20km has struck an moderately populated area in the Sulawesi Utara Province (population: 2.6 million) in Indonesia. &lt;a href=&apos;http://www.gdacs.org&apos;&gt;GDACS&lt;/a&gt; estimates the likelihood for need of international humanitarian intervention to be medium (Orange alert).

It is likely that a tsunami was generated. The maximum tsunami wave height near the coast of Indonesia, Sulawesi Tengah will be 1.6m. Please refer to the GDACS tsunami report for more details.

This earthquake can have a medium humanitarian impact since the affected region is moderately populated and has medium vulnerability to natural disasters.</comments>

<comments>On December 2008, Guyana has reached the height of the rainy season.  Many communities have been flooded with three feet of water and completely covered with mud and debris. The rains have eased for the moment, but flood waters have been slow to recede leading to foul smells and health issues have been identified including, skin rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea among others. Sanitation is an issue, as latrines and septic tanks are flooded. The government of Guyana has made efforts to clear and dig canals and have pumps working. Additional pumps are needed for some communities to remove stagnant water. Potable water through the main water systems has been affected, but only at the network level.  Water wells have not been affected. Losses incurred are those of cash crops farms and some livestock. Persons have saved household items by raising them above the flood waters.</comments>

<comments>Since early October 2008, very high morbidity and lethality rates associated with a cholera epidemic outbreak have been registered in the Maniema, Katanga, North and South Kivu provinces, precisely in the Kailo, Alunguli and Kindu health zones of Maniema and other towns like Lumumbashi, Likasi, Kolwezi, Bukama and kasenga; the health zones of Binza, Bwambizo, Goma, Karisimbi, Kirotche, Masisi, Rutchuru and Walikale health zones of North Kivu, and in many other localities of South Kivu. As of the 45th week of 2008, 25,503 cholera cases had been registered, including 515 deaths in the above mentioned localities. The following are statistics from the Ministry of Health (MoH). However, Red Cross efforts will be concentrated in the Lubumbashi, Likasi, Kolwezi, Bukama and Kasenga localities where the lethality rate is very high. On the last week of November, the Kipushi health zone was the most affected locality with several cases registered.</comments>

<comments>Acute humanitarian needs now exist in Kyrgyzstan, caused by a confluence of factors. Last year?s harsh winter, followed by low precipitation during the spring and summer of 2008, has depleted Kyrgyzstan?s hydroelectric resources and caused power cuts just when electricity is most needed for home heating. Soaring food and fuel prices, adverse weather and declining remittances have weakened the purchasing power of the most vulnerable and contributed to a precarious food security situation for some.</comments>

<comments>Tropical depression number 16 slowly crossed over Central America causing torrential rain. Several creeks near the capital city of San Salvador have started to overflow causing floods in some communities.  Landslides have taken place in many communities.  Several hydroelectric dams report having high levels of water forcing them to release the water, which in turn has caused streets to flood in several communities. The civil protection evacuated nine families from several communities.  To date, there are 19 families housed in different shelters in the country.</comments>

<comments>Up to 200 people are feared to have been buried in their homes after rockslides crushed a shantytown in the eastern Duwayqa area on 6 September 2008. Reports said that at least eight boulders - each estimated to weigh about 70 tonnes - fell from the towering cliffs overlooking the district at about 0900 local time (0700 GMT). Thirty people have been declared dead, 49 injured. 50 homes have been destroyed in the impoverished and densely populated Manshiyet Nasr neighbourhood.   Some people are believed to be still trapped in the rubble and police have cordoned off the area. The toll is expected to drastically raise, considering the number of missing, the hit, the dust and the difficulty of the search and rescue operation (difficult access for heavy equipment, high tensions between local population and governmental authorities).</comments>

No deaths have been reported so far. The Red Cross of Benin has deployed its team of volunteers to Enagnon, Dedokpo and Segbeya communities in Cotonou and Porto Novo, the capital city, to provide humanitarian assistance such as first aid and hygiene education to the families and those affected. Further cases are expected to be recorded in the coming days primarily because of the ongoing rains. The National Society and its volunteers will be providing assistance by furnishing cholera kits, and carrying out education and sensitization activities in the communities. The action is aimed at reducing the suffering those affected, their families and the communities at large.

<comments>The state of Bihar is facing one of the worst flooding in 50 years, as the River Kosi in Nepal has discharged huge levels of water, running down to the bordering districts of Bihar and inundating them. The worst fear is that a 2 km long breach in the mud embankment has lead to the change in the course of the River Kosi and thus affecting those districts which have not been affected by floods in past 50 years. </comments>

<comments>On 25 August 2008, a tropical depression in the Caribbean strengthened into tropical storm Gustav; on 26 August it rapidly became a category one hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale causing heavy rain in the southeastern part of Haiti.  The eye of hurricane Gustav made landfall on the southwest peninsula of Haiti, approximately 10 miles west of Jacmel, on 26 August shortly after 13:00.  Airports, sea ports and public offices have been closed and evacuation activities have begun.    The government has opened some 76 emergency shelters in the southern part of the country (Nippes: 20 emergency shelters have been opened) and has maintained a red alert in the departments of south east, south, Nippes, west, Grand-Anse, Artibonite and Centre.  Coordination between local authorities (local civil defence) and local Red Cross branches have been active. Regular information bulletins were provided by the government officials.</comments>

At the same time, the combined effect of the rainy season and the generally limited access to potable water and poor sanitation facilities have resulted in an outbreak of cholera in five districts. By 27 June 2008, over 388 cases had been reported, with 28 deaths (a CFR of 7.3%).  </comments>

<comments>Following the post-election violence in January and February 2008, Kenya is facing a number of challenges in ensuring food security for the vulnerable populations in the country. Crop production in 2008 is expected to be below average, primarily due to impact of post-election violence.  Low food supplies and high food prices already prevail. In addition, displaced persons have not yet been fully resettled and remain food insecure.

Although rainfall has been near normal for the April-June season for most parts of the country there are exceptions resulting in pockets of extreme drought following poor November rains</comments>

<comments>The situation in Zimbabwe which was the bread basket of Southern Africa has deteriorated; humanitarian situation in the country is compromised at the expense of all citizens. The country has been facing serious socio-economic decline compounded by the almost two-month stalemate after the 29 March 2008 harmonised elections. The declining situation has once again resulted in poor agricultural production and reduced manufacturing capacity. The shortage of basic food commodities and unpredictable rainfall patterns has threatened the food security of millions of people in the country.</comments>

The storm caused damage to more than 15 compounds, affecting more than 300 persons in Darsilameh. Houses were destroyed, and the families therefore have no shelter. The Government (through the Governor of the Western Region) created a crisis committee to coordinate the provision of support and assistance. Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) volunteers from the Western Region branch assisted those affected to move belongings from their ruined houses, and carried out assessments. The Gambia Red Cross Society plans to distribute roofing kits to shelter 300 beneficiaries. </comments>

<comments>Most of the 300,000 people displaced during the crisis are likely to continue living in camps for the next few months due to the lag in the implementation of the deal to resolve underlying ethnic problems. The majority of the displaced are from the productive breadbasket areas in the western part, and the crisis has already resulted in the loss of about 300,000 tonnes of the 2007 crop harvests, which will reduce overall food availability both locally and nationally in 2008. In addition, those displaced and confined in the camps may not fully cultivate their farms during the 2008 long&amp;#8208;rain cultivation season. Land preparation for the 2008 planting season has been significantly delayed with a significant reduction in prepared land due to tensions, insecurity and high input costs. This is expected to reduce the 2008 harvest of maize, the national staple food, meaning likely food shortages even in 2009. </comments>

<comments>Since October 2007, the Tungurahua volcano has been showing sustained increased activity,
particularly in the number and size of explosions. This activity increased on 29 December, when the
number of explosions registered in one day exceeded 100. On 2 January 2008, the highest number of
explosions was registered since September 2006. On the 6 January, nearly 1,000 people were evacuated. On 7 January in Runt?n, loud roars and earth tremors were felt. Seismic activity has intensified, and
at present is similar to that registered in May 2006, previous to the eruptions and pyroclastic flows of
July and August that same year.</comments>

The increased water levels in the rivers Terstena, Drini I Bardhe, Sitnica, Klina have broken the banks and have flooded the surrounding areas.  The flooding has caused damage to houses and personal belongings, agricultural land and equipment.  Some villages in the rural and poorer part of the province have been inaccessible so far.  An estimated 714 families (approx. 3,500 people) are affected by the flooding, many of which had to be evacuated from their houses and sheltered in neighbouring villages (with relatives, neighbours or friends).  </comments>

<comments>Severe drought has drastically reduced crop yields in Moldova, driving up food prices and reducing access to food for poor households, according to a joint report issued today FAO and WFP.
Cereal production is down by 63 percent compared to last year, and is about 70 percent lower than the average of the past five years.
&quot;Moldova?s 2007 drought has been the most severe in living memory and represents the extreme manifestation of a trend towards drier weather conditions in the country,&quot; said Henri Josserand, Chief of FAO?s Global Information and Early Warning System.

<comments>Torrential rainfall in northwestern Rwandan has left at least 15 people dead and damaged homes in three villages, leaving hundreds of people homeless, local leaders said. At least 562 houses were destroyed by flash floods, most of them in the villages of Bigogwe and Mukamira in Nyabihu district. Health officials, meanwhile, warned of the risk of disease outbreaks because of stagnant pools of water following the heavy downpour. (IRIN)
The worst-hit regions are in the northern hills of Rwanda. Officials said that a total of 562 families from the villages of Mukamira and Bigogwe have so far been displaced by the flooding and given temporary accomodation by the authorities. Heavy rains and floods have killed dozens and displaced hundreds of thousands in several regions of the African continent in recent weeks. (AFP)</comments>

<comments>Uganda&apos;s Ministry of Health (MoH) has confirmed an outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MHF) in Kitaka
goldmine, located in the Kakasi forest reserve, Kamwenge district, western Uganda. Reports from the Ministry indicate that two cases, with one death, were reported on 14 July 2007. The second case is under treatment and close monitoring. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the disease was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis on 30 July 2007. There is fear of at least 47 suspected cases in Kampala as a result of secondary transmission/contact from the first infected person who traveled to Kampala where he was being treated before his death. There are further fears of the potential spread of the disease in Kayunga district since some gold miners from Kitaka traveled back to their homes in Kayunga. This scenario puts the neighbouring districts of Mbarara, Kabarole and Mukono at high risk.</comments>

In Budalang?i, 4,278 people (713 families) have been displaced due to the bursting of River Nzoia. This is attributed to heavy rainfall at Cherengani Hills in Kitale and Chaptagat Forest. There are no rains at all being experienced in Budalang?i. It is not clear how many people have been marooned as an assessment is yet to be conducted. Elsewhere, an estimated 4,000 people are marooned at a village in Bunyala South between River Yala and River Nzoia.</comments>

<comments>A humanitarian crisis may be emerging in Burkina Faso with rains destroying people&apos;s homes and farmland in several areas across the country, the government&apos;s top crisis management expert said on 13 August. He said one of the worst-affected areas is the north province of Loroum, where flooding has washed away houses, schools and other infrastructure in 14 villages.
On 5 August two-thirds of all houses in the village of Banh were washed away after rain fell non-stop for 13 hours. Some 718 people were made homeless including 281 children. The national Red Cross told IRIN it is making its own assessment of the situation in the north on 14 August.

<comments>An earthquake occurred IN JAVA, INDONESIA, about 100 km (65 miles) E of JAKARTA or about 110 km (70 miles) N of Bandung at 11:04 AM MDT, Aug 8, 2007 (Aug 09 at 12:04 AM local time in Java, Indonesia). The magnitude and location may be revised when additional data and further analysis results are available. No reports of damage or casualties have been received at this time. Because this earthquake is located about 290 km below the surface of the earth, it will have been felt strongly over a wide area, but is not likely to cause severe damage. We have received reports that the earthquake was felt in much of Java and in parts of Malaysia. </comments>

<comments>HANOI, Aug 6, 2007 (AFP) - Heavy rains and floods in Vietnam have killed at least eight people and left 15 missing as a major tropical storm was threatening to make landfall this week, officials said Monday. 
Three people were swept away by flash floods in the central highlands province of Dak Lak and one died when his house collapsed Sunday in pounding rains, said provincial flood and storm control official Phan Thi Thu Hien. 
&quot;Fifteen people are still missing in our province and authorities are searching for them,&quot; Hien told AFP early Monday. 
Flooding from rains brought by the offshore storm also killed four people and inundated nearly 180 houses in neighbouring Lam Dong province, a popular tourist region, said the national committee on flood and storm control. 
The direction of the storm -- Vietnam&apos;s second in this year&apos;s flood and storm season that usually peaks from August to October -- remained difficult to forecast, said a national committee official in Hanoi. 
&quot;By Monday morning, the storm was about 110 kilometres (70 miles) off the Danang coast,&quot; said the official who asked not to be named. &quot;We cannot tell whether it will hit land yet as it seems to be travelling slowly up the coast.&quot; </comments>

<comments>As a result of heavy precipitation and the overflowing of the Zei reservoir, several settlements were flooded in Amur Oblast in the Far Eastern Okrug of the Russian Federation. The heavy rain began on 7 July and continued until 25 July. The amount of precipitation was 2.5 times higher than the average for Amur Oblast at this time of year. On 17 July an emergency was declared by the regional authorities.

Seven settlements were submerged under water, flooding a third of all homes and completely destroying 40, forcing the evacuation of 427 local residents including 100 children. Several settlements are completely blocked off from the outside world, roads and power lines having been severely damaged. The damage caused by flooding is estimated to have cost CHF 1,895,703. The water level in the Zei reservoir may continue to rise as a result of precipitation which is predicted to begin 28 July. If the water level rises another meter, 6,500-10,000 residents of 15 settlements will have to be evacuated.

<comments>A prolonged period of heavy rain has provoked severe flooding in central and western England, leaving at  least 350,000 homes without running water and 50,000 without power. The Severn, Avon, Thames, and Great Ouse are the major rivers, among others, that have either reached (or are expected to reach) critical levels. The situation is evolving, and while recent reports indicate that water levels may be receding, there remains a considerable threat that adverse weather may continue to exacerbate the flood situation, forcing more people to evacuate their homes and preventing the repair of major services such as water and electricity.</comments>

<comments>The current floods are affecting four constituencies, Kabbe, Katima Rural, Linyanti and Kongola. Some families have already been displaced by the floods especially those residing close to the river banks and the nearby flood plains such as Lisikili, Isize and Kabbe. The displaced communities lack basic necessities such as shelter, clean water and sanitation. The roads in the flood plain will be impassable in a few days. The government has identified temporary relocation sites at Lusese, Schuckmansburg, Kabbe and Impalila, but all of them are not yet cleared. No proper assessment has been done and the situation is worsened by lack of transport facilities such as vehicles and boats. Most of the fields in these villages are underwater and crops that are far from maturing are completely submerged. 
A total of 1,569 students from 11 schools in the Kabbe and Katima rural constituencies will be relocated to higher ground as their schools are already surrounded by flood water. The schools in upper land need assistance in the form of shelter and food for students and teachers. The villages located in low lying areas have also been put on alert for evacuation if the river continues rising and posing more threat of floods. Floods come against a background of high levels of poverty, worsened by one of the highest rates of HIV and AIDS prevalence region in the country.</comments>

<comments>On February 4 and 5 2007, Swaziland experienced heavy rains accompanied by strong winds with hail storms. They caused extensive damage to housing structures, destroyed food and other infrastructure such as telephone and electricity lines which resulted in frequent telecommunication and power black outs. Hectares of crops were also destroyed which indicates the possibility of food insecurity in the coming months. The regions affected are
Shiselweni and Lubombo. Approximately, 73 households were affected in both regions by losing shelter, food and having property damaged. The situation is still evolving and the needs will be increasing. Up to 500 households could be affected.</comments>

<comments>In two separate flooding incidents, both the islands of Vanua Levu and the western part of Viti Levu were affected, on the 3rd and 10th of February respectively. In Vanua Levu, heavy rains caused flooding in many areas including the town of Labasa. Poor drainage systems, heavy silting in rivers and uncontrolled logging contributed to the flooding. There was damage to housing, schools and crops, and one casualty. About 900 people were evacuated to 11 shelters where they received assistance from the Government and the Fiji Red Cross. On Viti Levu, the town of Nadi was flooded as well as villages along the Sigatoka valley. The flood waters have since subsided, but a landslide severed access to seven villages with 1000 people in the Sigatoka valley. Government assessments and relief efforts are on-going, and there has been no request for international assistance.</comments>

<comments>In January Paraguay has faced an epidemiological emergency due to the presence of the Aedes Aegiptys mosquito ? which carries the virus that causes dengue - across the country. By the end of December 2006, the total number of confirmed cases in the country was 366. Throughout January, the number of cases of people with dengue increased to 1,000 - as confirmed by the Ministry of Public Health on 25 January - indicating that the situation had progressed to an epidemiological emergency. The capital city of Asunci?n still has the highest number of cases (78 percent of the total); however half of the country?s health sector regions are now affected.
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare declared an epidemiological alert, following the confirmation of 140 cases of dengue during the first weeks of January 2007 and the possibility of an epidemic outbreak of the fatal hemorrhagic strain of the virus. The Ministry declared an epidemiological alert in light of three factors: the rapid circulation of the serotype of the dengue virus, the existence of a large number of people susceptible to contracting the disease for a second time and large numbers of the transmitter mosquito.</comments>

The Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining Increased seismic activity of the volcano Galeras, located in the department of Nari?o in south-western Colombia, led the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining (INGEOMINAS) to change its alert phase to Level II (likely eruption in days or weeks) on 28 March 2006. In 2005, the alert phase stood at Level II twice: for a month and a half in April/May, and for 24 days in November. Several communities around the volcano are at high risk in Pasto, Nari?o and La Florida. According to updated figures from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), 8,463 residents would need to be evacuated.</comments>

<comments>A low atmospheric depression over the Bay of Bengal caused a violent storm at sea and along the coastal belt of Bangladesh on 19 September 2006. It generated tornados that struck various localities and caused heavy rain across the country for over four days. According to media reports, the sudden storm capsized hundreds of fishing trawlers and other boats, as well as a Bangladesh navy ship in the Bay of Bengal, which were caught unaware. About 1,000-1,500 fishermen and a naval commander are reported missing. According to some reports, around 115 bodies were recovered (as on 28 September) and so far 6,000 survivors have returned home. </comments>

<comments>A large scale eruption occurred at Rabaul Volcano at 08:45 (local time) on 7 October in New Britain Island, Papua New Guinea. Continuous air blasts rattled windows in Rabaul city and heavy ash fall and small stones were falling in the city. The volcanic activity is likely continue along with ash falls. The state of emergency remained in effect although there are indications that it will be lifted in the next day or two.  

In the event of heavy rains, small to moderate sized mud flows are likely to follow existing water courses.  Residents to the south and south-west should exercise extra caution. Air Niugini confirmed that flights into Rabaul were suspended until further notice and the airport remains closed due to continuing deposits of ash on the runway.

<comments>Unusually heavy rains fell in many regions in Chad in recent weeks, resulting in floods in the capital city
(N?Djamena) and in various areas of the country. Reports indicated some 52 people died, and there was extensive damage to infrastructure, including houses and social service structures. The most affected places are N?Djamena,Sahr, Doba, B?bidja, Gor?, Pala and Koumra. Tens of thousands of people were displaced, and many others were scattered in unhealthy muddy grounds with significant risks of epidemic outbreak.
Acting on several alert messages from the affected areas, the Chadian government instructed urgent action from the National Committee of Flood Management (CONASI) to assess the extent of damage and subsequent needs of the effected population. The Committee members which include technical WatSan experts and senior officials from the Ministries of Interior and Territorial Administration; Social Affairs, Public Health, and other sensitive sectors with civil protection mandates, have been deployed to visit various scenes of the disaster in N?Djamena. Similar
instructions were given to the regional and local authorities to conduct rapid assessments upon which the
government and its partner humanitarian organisations could build plans to access the victims with adequate quality assistance.
Official statistics (as of 6 September) reflected the following:
? In B?bidja, 15 days of heavy rains with a recorded water level of 346 mm rendered 1,063 families homeless
(average size five persons) homeless. 1,706 houses; 217 sanitation facilities (bathrooms and toilets)
destroyed; 18 water wells; and 626 walls/and house fences were destroyed or collapsed.
? In Doba: 1,187 houses and 44 walls collapsed, 365 hectares of agricultural land were inundated; many
livestock losses were reported; 135 bags of cereals and 30 bags of cement were spoiled by the waters.
? In Koumra: 839 houses were destroyed, and many walls and fences collapsed (including the walls of the
city mosque and those of the local prison).
In addition to these, more than 145 mm of rain fall was registered on 17 August in the area of Kanem Matchouna, with an extensive impact on those living in the area. Government authorities at the regional and local levels are conducting further assessments to transmit details on damage and needs in other areas affected by the floods.</comments>

The death toll was largely due to the fact that the flooding took place in an urban area at a time when people were asleep. The floods follow a devastating drought that hit the east African region, threatening the lives of about 15 million people.</comments>

<comments>Since the beginning of July, heavy rains have been pouring down in the region of Brakna, South-eastern part of
Nouakchott, Mauritania, flooding the region and leaving several families homeless. The worst came with a storm in
the night of 22 July, killing seven people among them five members of the same family including two children, who
perished in the village of Ednesh, 19 people were injured. The wind and flooding have left about 320 families homeless in several villages and towns with Boutilimit, 150 km away from Nouakchott, being the most affected.
The state radio has reported that the severe storms and flooding in this part of the arid and dry country, which
experiences these kinds of hazards during the rainy season, will last until October. The city of Aleg alone recorded
102 ml of rain that caused flooding, with about 160 displaced families accommodated in provisional shelters in
schools. Most of these populations have also lost their crops and most of their belongings. In response, the state has
set up a crisis committee that deployed a team right after the storm struck and distributed food items, about 150
tents and blankets.

The earthquake occurred as a result of thrust-faulting on the boundary between the Australia plate and the Sunda plate. On this part of their mutual boundary, the Australia plate moves north-northeast with respect to the Sunda plate at about 59 mm/year. The Australia plate thrusts beneath the Sunda plate at the Java trench, south of Java, and is subducted to progressively greater depths beneath Java and north of Java. The earthquake occurred on the shallow part of the plate boundary, about 50 km north of the Java trench.</comments>

<comments>1.	On 27 March 2006 the volcano Ubinas, located in the district of Ubinas in the province of General S?nchez Cerro, department of Moquegua, in the south of the country, started emitting smoke and ash after almost 40 years of inactivity. Since 13 April, an increase in seismic activity has been recorded and ash, smoke and toxic gas emissions have intensified with ash falling on the towns of Ubinas, Querapi and Sacohaya. On 14 April, sulphuric gases released in the atmosphere generated acid rains, affecting the same localities. On 20 and 21 April, explosions spewed out incandescent stones and ash in a 4 km radius from the crater. In the course of 23 April there was a scale-up in terms of volcanic activity, with 5 explosions and 200 tremors in the time span of 48 hours.</comments>

<comments>The rainy season, which began in early 2006 in the northern Argentine provinces of Salta, Jujuy and Formosa, has intensified significantly since the end of March. Due to the mountainous terrain in the area, heavy rains have caused flooding and landslides near some of the region?s main rivers, destroying at least 150 homes and several bridges.

<comments>From 8 to 10 April 2006, torrential rains fell in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its surroundings. This has caused numerous and serious material damages as well as human casualties. The rains of the recent days were particularly violent and at times caused landslides.
Early reports indicate that seven councils have been seriously affected.  In the final analysis, there are extensive material damages that need to be thoroughly
collapsed, crops have been destroyed and roads have been washed away. According to the teams in the field, the situation is alarming, especially in the Kisenso Council which is the most affected.</comments>

<comments>Tropical cyclone &quot;Daryl&quot; spawned a stormy weather off the western coast of Australia during the second week of January. The cyclonic winds from this disturbance descended upon the island of Timor-Leste for four days and destroyed more than 500 houses and corn and rice crops in at least four districts (Ainaro, Bobnaro, Baucau &amp; Viqueque). The situation in the district became worse on 31 January when it rained for eleven hours. The Tono River broke its bank and inundated the surrounding villages. At least ten upland and lowland villages affected.

<comments>1.	Mt. Ambae volcano erupted on 27 November in Ambae Island of Vanuatu.  Twelve to fifteen villages with a total population of about 5,000 have been affected. No casualties have been reported. There are no damages to houses except that they are covered with ash. Although people are still living in their homes, ash could affect their respiratory system and contaminate the source of water supply. Food crops have also been covered with ash. They have crops to last for only one to two weeks. 

2.	Ambae has a crater lake. There is a risk that the volcano could further erupt and cause flooding in the valleys. The Government may need to evacuate about 5,000 people in the high-risk area. The National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) is working on an evacuation plan.

<comments>&amp;#61607;	The Karthala Volcano had an eruption for the second time this year in the night of Thursday 24 November, spilling ashes and smoke over the south-eastern and south-western parts of Grande Comore Island, and the Comoros capital, Moroni. 
&amp;#61607;	During Friday 25, the projections of ashes and smoke receded. However, seismographic data collected by the Karthala Volcanologic Observatory has shown that the seismic activity is continuing. According to the observatory, a lava lake is in formation in the crater, as of yet confined within the crater. 
&amp;#61607;	According to the local authorities, approximately 2,000 people fled from their villages in the region of Bambao in the central part of the island, and sought refuge in less exposed areas, such as Mitsamiouli, Mboud?, and Oichili.

<comments>Over the past twenty (24) hours, The National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) has received numerous reports of flooding, landslides and damages to properties due to the passage of Tropical Depression #27.  The Met Office reported that rains commenced on Sunday 13th at approximately 115 pm and continued Monday dumping over 116 millimetres (4.5 inches) of rain during that 24 hour period.  The flooding has been mainly concentrated in the south and west of the island.

The Damage Assessment process has begun after Monday?s heavy and consistent rains.  The bodies of two fishermen have been recovered on the Grenadine island of Bequia; the men were buried by an early morning landslide on Monday.  Damage to the pipe network from river flooding and landslides have resulted in the closure of 11 schools Tuesday.

<comments>Aceh Tenggara District, NAD
1.	On 18 October, heavy rains caused a flash flood and a number of landslides, inundating an area in two sub-districts, Kecamatan Semadam and Kecamatan Bukit Tusam. Six villages are reported to have been affected. The flood and landslide carrying mud inundated about 400-500 houses, affecting 1,000 internally displaced persons. At least 5 people are reported dead. The Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) reported that the disaster seriously injured 68 people and slightly injured another 143.

2.	Limited road access due to thick mud has created difficulties to quickly move the affected communities from their houses. There is no electricity and clean water in the affected villages. The road from Medan to Kutacane is open and accessible, and communication using mobile phone was reportedly possible in the affected area.

Malang District, East Java
3.	Floods and landslides, triggered by torrential rains, hit four sub-districts in Malang District of East Java Province on 17 October, affecting 12 villages, and killing one person and injuring another. 

4.	Initial reports indicate that the landslides damaged 284 houses, a mosque and a bridge.  The floodwater, between 40 cm to 1 m high, inundated 105 houses, an elementary school, and 610 hectares of paddy fields. Many of the affected people moved in with families and neighbors in safer areas.

<comments>Heavy rainstorms with gale-force winds were recorded on 31 August in Port Sudan. Several administrative units (Central, Eastern, Southern Administrative Units, Arbaat and Suakin) suffered most damage.  Approximately 156,000 people were affected, including 17,000 (3340 households) whose homes and belongings were totally destroyed. 

The rainstorm destroyed most of the houses made of mats/grass sheeting or timber, roofs of schools in the area blown off, the few household items owned by IDPs were blown away and latrines flooded. The available water sources were flooded resulting in further contamination by seawater; the price of clean water consequently doubled (from 50SDD to 100SDD).   Victims in certain areas ? mainly IDPs from South Sudan, Nuba mountains, Western Sudan, Eritrea and from within Red Sea state- are living in the open next to their destroyed homes.

<comments>Hurricane Rita hit the Texas-Louisiana coastal region. The storm created significant storm surge of at least 4.6 m (15 feet) and wind damage with some inland flooding in the Florida panhandle, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Prior to landfall, Rita reached a pressure of 897 mb. In the Louisiana Parishes of Cameron, Jefferson Davis, Terrebonne and Vermilion, the storm surge caused sugar cane crop losses near $300 million (Reuters). A 2.4 meter (8-foot) storm surge in New Orleans overtopped the provisionally-repaired levees (from Hurricane Katrina damage) and caused additional flooding. NOAA reports that Hurricane Rita caused $11.3 billion in damages  and 119 deaths.

<comments>Over 100,000 families have been affected by severe flooding in Northern Thailand?s Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai,
Lampang, Lamphun, Mae Hong Son, Nakhon Phanom, Nan, Phayao and Tak provinces which commenced in the
middle of August. Some 2,100 homes and thousands of hectares of crop land were destroyed due to the
overwhelming force of runoffs from the Ping River. Torrential rains which earlier in August hammered Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Sorn inundated more than 4 500 villagers? homes in these three provinces alone
leaving 4 people dead and making several roads impassable to small vehicles. At present, the meteorological department has warned seven provinces in the north and northeast of the possibility of flash floods. Flood-prone areas in Nakhon Phanom, Nong Khai, Mukdahan, Ubon Ratchathani, Chiang Rai, Phayao, and Nan provinces are
currently being viewed as the areas facing the highest risk for the time being, and the governor has issued an
urgent order for local officials at the district, sub-dstrict and the municipal levels to be on alert.</comments>

<comments>As a result of eight hours of heavy rains that occurred on 7 August, 2005 the heaviest and worst floods in 40 years occurred in Jalingo, the state capital of Taraba (north-east of Nigeria, bordering Cameroon), killing over 100 people and displacing more than 50,000 others. Hundreds of people on the River Jalingo Bridge linking the state of Taraba with other parts of the country were in immediate danger of being swept away when the bridge caved in, and 80 of them were swept away by the powerful currents. Among those feared dead was an assistant commissioner of police who had gone to disperse the crowds from the bridge. The policeman hung on the bridge?s rails for over three hours waiting for assistance. Other victims were passengers who were being conveyed across the bridge. 40 bodies had been recovered by 26 August 2005 and five people were rescued.</comments>

<comments>From 6-7 August, the southern part of the Central African Republic was hit by torrential rains.  The heavy downpour caused varying degrees of damage to all areas of the capital city, Bangui, and severe flooding and destruction to four districts of the city, Malimaka, Ngaraba-Bangouma, Being and Petevo, along the southern banks of the Ubangui River.  An assessment carried out by the Central African Republic Red Cross concluded that the floods affected approximately 9,076 people at the onset of the crisis.  In addition, over 600 homes were completely destroyed and 800 were damaged.  Water sources and wells were polluted, exposing the population to risks of water-borne diseases.  The floods particularly affected the poorest and most heavily populated districts of Bangui.</comments>

<comments>As a result of heavy rains and storms at the end of May and beginning of June (25 May to 10 June), nine regions in the north of Bulgaria ? with a population of some two million people - have been affected. Three persons have been reported dead. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Rousse, Dve Mogili, Lukovit, Pravec, Mezdra, Roman, Svoge and in Sofia. As the water levels of the Iskar, Vit, Osam, and Struma rivers rose rapidly and dam capacity in the region reached a critical point, authorities initiated controlled draining of the Studena, Jovkovci, Aleksandar Stamboliiski dams, resulting in infrastructure damage to roads, railways, electro and water supply systems and telecommunications, as well as to personal property (flooded basements, houses and farms).</comments>

<comments>Langila volcano, located in Papua New Guinea?s West New Britain province, 200km west of the provincial capital, Kimbe, has been erupting continuously since Thursday, 2 June 2005 and discharging heavier than normal loads of ash into the sky. Although the prevailing wind conditions pushed most of the initial ash fall out to sea, lower -level winds are now redirecting the ash back onto the island.
This has led to reports of increasing cases of respiratory and eye irritation complaints and a growing concern that it will become necessary to evacuate the local population. Approximately 10,000 people are reported to live in the
vicinity of the volcano.</comments>

<comments>Flood,Serbia Montenegro: Due to heavy rains in April and snow melting in Romania?s Carpathian Mountains, the water level of the Tamis River (on the Romania/Serbia border) has risen rapidly. As a consequence, on 20 April at 21:00 the water overflowed the river banks and broke the dike on the Romanian side of the river, flooding the area surrounding the Jasa Tomic village in Serbia. The village is situated in the municipality of Secanj, in the eastern part of Vojvodina where 2,996 inhabitants (1,000 households) live. Sixty percent (60%) of the population is elderly, and forty percent (40%) live on agricultural production. Initial reports indicate that 700 houses are completely flooded, and 100 have been destroyed by the water. Since most of the houses are constructed out of clay bricks, there is a fear that many more houses will be heavily damaged or completely destroyed when the water withdraws.

<comments>Unprecedented heavy rainfall in Zanzibar Island for two consecutive days (17-18 April 2005) has led to heavy flooding in what has been described as the worst in 40 years. The flooding has completely submerged several hundred houses, totally damaged a few and destroyed infrastructure in six of the hardest hit administrative locations/wards of Mwanakelekwe, Jang&apos;ombe, Sebuleni, Karahani, Mombasa and Miembeni in Zanzibar urban.

To date, no resulting deaths or injuries have been reported by the government; however, 150 families have been formally registered to have been rendered homeless, and have been given temporary accommodation in three schools (closed due to the flooding). As of Wednesday 20 April, 2005, sixty-four (64) houses had been destroyed in urban areas and 10 in rural areas. All household items were lost in
the deluge.</comments>

<comments>Djibouti is currently facing worsening drought conditions due to the consequences of two consecutive failed rainy seasons, where erratic rainfall patterns adversely affected the replenishment of water catchments and the regeneration of pastures.  Delayed rains resulted in abnormal pastoral migration patterns and a further depletion of already exhausted pasture and browse in all grazing areas.  The rain has also been insufficient to replenish much-needed water sources throughout the country and it is below the threshold for pasture regeneration.  All water catchments in the south are practically dry. 

The food security and livelihoods of 5,000 families (28,650 people) have been severely compromised by limited water and pasture.  Significant over-grazing of pasture and the depletion of water sources have contributed to widespread livestock deaths and a considerable decline in milk productivity.  The remaining animals are in bad conditions due mainly to opportunistic parasites and diseases.

<comments>The Karthala Volcano has been showing signs of increasing activity over the past week. This activity has escalated further since Saturday 16 April in late afternoon, with clouds of ash and smoke affecting a number of villages in the Dimani and Pidjani regions in the eastern part of the island. Reports also indicate that some rivers flowing on the flank of the volcano have become polluted with volcanic debris.
On Sunday 17 April, populations from these villages began to flee in fear of gas and lava flow. According to the local authorities, as many as 10,000 people may have fled from their homes in the eastern region in order to seek refuge in other parts of the island. </comments>

<comments>As of 15 February 2005, WHO has received reports of 61 deaths of pneumonic plague in Ituri district, Oriental province in the northern part of the country (see map below). The total number of cases is still not known. Preliminary results from rapid diagnostic tests in the area confirm pneumonic plague, and the cases had clinical features compatible with this disease. Forty samples have been taken and will be tested by culture and serology at the Institut de la Recherche Biomedicale, Kinshasa. No cases of bubonic plague have been reported to date.
The cases have occurred in workers in a diamond mine in Zobia where c. 7000 people work. The mine was re-opened on 16 December 2004 and the first case occurred on 20 December.</comments>

<comments>For several days, heavy rains have been falling over the Atlantic region of Costa Rica, causing several of the main rivers in the province of Limon to overflow. Flooding has caused damage to housing, agriculture and
communication systems. To date, a total of 1,550 people have been evacuated and at least 50 shelters have been set up in Sarapiqu?, Gu?piles, Bribr?, Cahuita, Puerto Viejo and Valle de la Estrella, which are housing some 1,100 families. Several national highways have been closed because of the flooding and landslides, making access to the region more difficult and cutting off several communities. There is currently only one route open to the affected area. Many residents in these areas have taken refuge on rooftops while they await assistance. The National
Meteorological Institute is predicting that the heavy rains will last for at least two more days. The rains are also affecting the Atlantic province of Bocas del Toro in Panama, which borders Costa Rica.</comments>

<comments>COLOMBO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A huge earthquake hit southern Asia on Sunday, setting off a tsunami that drowned hundreds in Sri Lanka and India, sent Indonesians rushing to high ground and washed away bathers on the Thai tourist island of Phuket.
The earthquake of magnitude 8.5 as measured by the U.S. Geological Survey first struck at 7:59 a.m (0059 GMT) off the coast of the northern Indonesian island of Sumatra and swung north with multiple tremors into the Andaman islands in the Indian Ocean.
A wall of water up to 10 metres (30 feet) high set off by the tremor swept into Indonesia, over the coast of Sri Lanka and India and along the southern Thai tourist island of Phuket, leaving at least 650 people feared dead, officials said.</comments>

<comments>COLOMBO (Reuters) - Two-thirds of the Maldives capital has been flooded after a series of tsunami waves triggered by an earthquake swamped the low-lying Indian Ocean archipelago, the chief government spokesman has said.
&quot;The damage is considerable,&quot; Ahmed Shaheed told Reuters. &quot;The island is only about three feet (one metre) above sea level and a wave of water four feet (1.3 metres) high swept over us.&quot;

Male, which is 2 km (1.25 miles) long and 800 metres (half a mile) wide and home to 75,000 people, is bursting at the seams.

The streets of white-washed houses are heavily built up, living conditions often cramped and areas of communal open space sparse for the country&apos;s 300,000 people.</comments>

<comments>BANKGOK (Reuters) - An unprecedented tsunami tossed cars around like toys on Thailand&apos;s southern tourist playground and swept into luxury hotels on Phuket island, killing at least 120 people in the region, officials say.
More than 1,000 were injured and the government ordered the evacuation of the stricken areas, which included the main beaches of Phuket which are popular with Western and Asian tourists and at the height of their season.

Thai authorities sent out helicopters to assess the damage in a region of exotically shaped limestone islands scattered in the turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea popular with snorkellers and recreational divers among Thailand&apos;s annual 12 million tourists.</comments>

<comments>Hurricane Jeanne made landfall as a category 3 hurricane in east-central Florida. The storm caused considerable wind, storm surge, and flooding damage in Florida, with some flood damage also in the states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia. Puerto Rico was also affected (http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html#chron). NOAA reports $6.9 billion in damages . One direct death was reported from Puerto Rico, three direct deaths were reported in Florida, and one direct death was reported from South Carolina. In Clay County, Florida, a boy was playing outside during high winds and an oak tree limb fell striking him on the head. In Brevard County, Florida, a man was driving his truck onto a flooded road but the flow carried his truck into a drainage canal where the truck then submerged and he drowned. In Indian River County, Florida, an elderly woman was leaving her home to go to a shelter when a door was blown open by wind throwing her to the ground causing fractures. She was hospitalized for her injuries and died a few days later. In Fairfield County, South Carolina, a man died in a tornado on 27 September. In Patrick County, Virginia, a female drowned in a flash flood near her home.

<comments>Torrential rains accompanied by heavy winds and landslides during 13th and 14th of July have resulted in localized flooding in the Varzob rayon of Tajikistan. At this time the information is still sketchy but no casualties have been reported. An elevated water level in the Varzob river has swelled and swept away parts of the main road connecting Dushanbe to the northern city of Khujand, along the Dushanbe-Anzob-Istar avshan route.

<comments>Two weeks of heavy rain in the Dominican Republic resulted in sudden serious flooding affecting most of the country. The areas reporting the worst damage include the northeast, southeast, west and eastern valley of Ciboa, with the area of Jimani, near the border with Haiti, being the worst hit (the Jimani River burst its banks on Monday at dawn). As a result, water hurtled through the homes in the nearby valley flooding hundreds of homes, and sweeping away whole families. </comments>

More than a week of fires have claimed 14 lives in Portugal and ravaged an area of forest almost two-thirds the size of Greater London. Neighboring Spain recorded its 13th death due to the soaring temperatures. In Germany, which like most of usually cooler northern Europe has not been spared, there were five heat-related deaths in one German town alone over the weekend. The heat in Britain claimed its first victims when two teenage boys drowned trying to cool off.</comments>

<comments>Hurricane Isabel made landfall as a category 2 hurricane in eastern North Carolina. The storm caused considerable storm surge damage along the coasts of Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia, with wind damage and some flooding due to 4-12 inch rains in NC, VA, MD, DE, WV, NJ, NY, and PA.
NOAA reports damages of $3.37 billion.
Isabel is directly responsible for 16 deaths: 10 in Virginia, and 1 each in North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Florida. The deaths in Florida and Rhode Island were drownings in high surf generated by Isabel. Isabel was indirectly responsible for 34 deaths: 22 in Virginia, 6 in Maryland, 2 in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and 1 each in New Jersey and the District of Columbia.</comments>

<comments>The persistent remnants of Tropical Storm Allison produced rainfall amounts of 30-40 inches in portions of coastal Texas and Louisiana, causing severe flooding especially in the Houston area. The storm then moved slowly northeastward; fatalities and significant damage reported in TX, LA, MS, FL, VA, and PA. NOAA reports $5 billion in damages. Twenty-two deaths were caused by Allison, with each of these fatalities occurred in Harris County.

NOAA reports $4.5 billion in damages. There were 57 deaths that were directly attributable to Floyd, 56 in the United States and 1 in Grand Bahama Island. The death toll by state is as follows: North Carolina 35, Pennsylvania 6, New Jersey 6, Virginia 3, Delaware 2, New York 2, Connecticut 1, and Vermont 1. Most of these deaths were due to drowning in freshwater flooding. Floyd was the deadliest hurricane in the United States since Agnes of 1972.

<comments>Though Mitch never entered Nicaragua, its large circulation caused extensive rainfall. An estimated 3800 dead with perhaps as many as 7,000 others still missing. Two million people directly affected and 500,000 - 800,000 homeless. </comments>

<comments>During the week of January 5-9, 1998, the eastern U.S. and eastern Canada were severely effected by a storm system with a very deep southerly flow and abundant moisture. This resulted in flooding rains from the lower Mississippi valley through the southeast and into the northeast, several tornadoes, and a severe ice storm in parts of the northeast/New England and into Canada. The death toll for the event:
Flood-related:
Tennessee--7
North Carolina--2
South Carolina--1
Kentucky--1
Alabama--1
Ice storm-related:
New York--9
Maine--5
New Hampshire--2

The heaviest rains and most severe flooding occurred in the mountains of North Carolina and northeast Tennessee, where up to 16 inches fell in a 2-day period. See below for some of the rainfall totals. Surveys indicate over 500 homes destroyed or with severe damage in North Carolina, and over 200 homes severely damaged or destroyed in Tennessee. Damages exceeded $15 million for western North Carolina and $20 million for eastern Tennessee. Tornado touchdowns produced some damage in Dublin, Georgia and Easley, South Carolina. Flooding also was a problem in parts of the lower Mississippi valley and upstate New York.

The severe ice storm mainly affected upstate New York, northern New Hampshire and Vermont, much of Maine, and southeast Canada. Some locations received over 3 inches of rain (as freezing rain), with radial ice thickness of one inch or more. Canada reported over 3 million utility customers without power immediately after the storm, while the northeast through New England reported over 500,000 customers without power. 80% of Maine&apos;s population lost electrical service. Overall damages approached $3 billion for Canada and were at least $1.4 billion for the U.S.  </comments>

<comments>Hurricane Bonnie made landfall as a category 3 hurricane striking eastern North Carolina and Virginia with extensive agricultural damage due to winds and flooding, with 10-inch rains in 2 days in some locations.
NOAA reports $720 million in damges. Three people died as a consequence of Bonnie. A 12-year old girl was killed when a large tree fell on her home in Currituck County, NC. Another person was caught in rip currents and drowned in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The third person died in Cape Cod in a rowboat accident when choppy seas overturned the boat. The last one may have been indirectly related to Bonnie.

<comments>Category 3 hurricane strikes North Carolina and Virginia, over 10-inch 24-hour rains in some locations and extensive agricultural and other losses NOAA reports $3.2 billion in damages. According to Associated Press reports, Hurricane Fran was responsible for 34 deaths. Most of the deaths were caused by flash flooding in the Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Twenty-one died in North Carolina alone. However, the total death count will likely be revised downward in the next update of this report based on data from NWS personnel to be published in Storm Data, since the NWS attempts to list deaths directly attributable to the weather. For example, most vehicle accidents and heart attacks from over-exertion after a hurricane are not considered direct deaths. The Property Claim Services Division of the American Insurance Services Group reports that Fran caused an estimated $1.6 billion dollars in insured property damage to the United States.</comments>

<comments>The May 18, 1980, eruption was the most destructive in the history of the United States. Novarupta (Katmai) Volcano, Alaska, erupted considerably more material in 1912, but owing to the isolation and sparse population of the region affected, there were no human deaths and little property damage. In contrast, Mount St. Helens&apos; eruption in a matter of hours caused loss of lives and widespread destruction of valuable property, primarily by the debris avalanche, the lateral blast, and the mudflows.

Landscape changes caused by the May 18 eruption were readily seen on high-altitude photographs. Such images, however, cannot reveal the impacts of the devastation on people and their works. The May 18 eruption resulted in scores of injuries and the loss of 57 lives. Within the United States before May 18, 1980, only two known casualties had been attributed to volcanic activity - a photographer was struck by falling rocks during the explosive eruption of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in 1924; and an Army sergeant who disappeared during the 1944 eruption of Cleveland Volcano, Chuginadak Island, Aleutians. Autopsies indicated that most of Mount St. Helens&apos; victims died by asphyxiation from inhaling hot volcanic ash, and some by thermal and other injuries.  Accurate cost figures remain difficult to determine. Early estimates were too high and ranged from $2 to $3 billion, primarily reflecting the timber, civil works, and agricultural losses. A refined estimate of $1.1 billion was determined in a study by the International Trade Commission at the request of Congress. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</comments>

<comments>This powerful, deadly, and destructive hurricane formed just west of the Cayman Islands on August 14. It rapidly intensified and by the time it reached western Cuba the next day it was a Category 3 hurricane. Camille tracked north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and became a Category 5 hurricane on August 16. The hurricane maintained this intensity until it made landfall along the Mississippi coast late on the 17th. Camille weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed Mississippi into western Tennessee and Kentucky, then it turned eastward across West Virginia and Virginia. The cyclone moved into the Atlantic on August 20 and regained tropical storm strength before becoming extratropical on the 22nd. A minimum pressure of 26.84 inches was reported in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, which makes Camille the second most intense hurricane of record to hit the United States. The actual maximum sustained winds will never be known, as the hurricane destroyed all the wind-recording instruments in the landfall area. The estimates at the coast are near 200 mph. Columbia, Mississippi, located 75 miles inland, reported 120 mph sustained winds. A storm tide of 24.6 ft occurred at Pass Christian, Mississippi. The heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast were about 10 inches. However, as Camille passed over the Virginias, it produced a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches. Most of this rain occurred in 3 to 5 hours and caused catastrophic flash flooding. The combination of winds, surges, and rainfalls caused 256 deaths (143 on the Gulf Coast and 113 in the Virginia floods) and $1.421 billion in damage.</comments>
